extract_confident_query.py -
    We made this script to pull out a specific sequence from a FASTA file.

    It's used after we find that a query sequence got a "High-confidence match"
    in the HMMER search, and we want to use it for BLAST annotation.

    Basically, it just looks through the FASTA file and finds the sequence
    for the given query ID.
